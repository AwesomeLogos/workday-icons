# Workday Icons

Workday has several [sets of icons](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=workday%20icons) that are available on npm, but not available on Github.

This repo just republishes them on Github so they can be indexed and viewed on [IconSearch](https://iconsear.ch).


## Licenses

The icons have different licenses in the
`README.md` file [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
versus the `LICENSE.txt` file [CC BY-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/).
